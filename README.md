# byuu's personal website (archived)

After byuu retired in July 2020,
he took this website offline
since he was no longer willing to maintain it.
However,
since so many other websites have linked to it over the years,
the most important and interesting content has been collected and preserved.

> **A note about names:**
> Although he went by "byuu" for most of his career,
> in March 2020 he briefly changed his name to Near.
> Since most of the content of this site was written as "byuu",
> since it's the more-familiar name,
> and since he signed his July 2020 farewell message as "byuu",
> we'll use that name for consistency.
