# byuu's personal website (archived)

After byuu/Near retired in July 2020,
he took this website offline
since he was no longer willing to maintain it.

However,
since so many other websites have linked to it over the years,
the most important and interesting content has been collected and preserved.

This content has been manually converted to Markdown for ease of presentation;
if you find any conversion errors,
please [file an issue](https://github.com/byuu/byuu.org).
