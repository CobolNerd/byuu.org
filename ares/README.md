ares is a multi-system emulator
that began development as "bsnes" on October 14th, 2004.
After byuu retired in March 2020
and handed development of [higan](../higan/) over to the community,
he resumed working on it to keep himself busy during the COVID-19 pandemic,
under the title "ares".

The first public release of ares was v114, on June 7th, 2020.

In July 2020, when byuu retired again,
he released ares v115 and again handed development over to the community.

The original ares v115 source is available
[on GitHub](https://github.com/ares-emu/ares/tree/286421e6e6a803a3ec36380593aed5c20a4e8c48),
but ares' changes will be integrated into the community's repository for higan.
